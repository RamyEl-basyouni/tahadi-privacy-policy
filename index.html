    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="textCenter">Last updated: July 24, 2022</p>
    <p>
      Tahadi (“we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This
      Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute
      information through our software, website, documentation, and related
      services (together, the “Services”). Capitalized terms not defined in this
      Privacy Policy have the meaning as set forth in the Terms of Service for
      the Services, which can be found at http://www.Tahadi.sa/terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are visiting us from the European Union or European Economic Area,
      please be sure to read to section entitled “Additional Information for
      European Union Users” for information on how we comply with privacy laws
      applicable to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Services, you consent to the use of your Personal Information
      as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are not of legal age to form a
      binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use
      the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s or legal
      guardian’s express consent. Furthermore, children under the age of 13
      cannot use or register for the Services in any way. Review this Privacy
      Policy with your parent or legal guardian make sure you understand it.
      Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will
      not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We do not actively
      collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale of such information
      in a way that specifically identifies the individual (i.e. we don’t sell
      customer lists). You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your
      Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result
      in your inability to continue using some or all of the Services.
    </p>
    <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
    <h3>Personal Information:</h3>
    <p>
      When using or registering to use the Services, we may require you to
      provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your device.
      For the sake of clarity, we do not collect information regarding your
      name, email, phone number, or personal contacts in any way when you
      register for or use the Services. When using the Services, you may
      voluntarily provide us with personally identifiable information, such as
      when communicating with us or uploading a profile picture. Such
      information is referred to below as your “Personal Contact Information.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also obtain Personal Contact Information about you in other ways,
      both during and after registration.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such way is if you voluntarily provide us your email address. After
      registering to use the Services, you have the option to provide us an
      email address to associate with your Tahadi user account. This is entirely
      voluntary and your decision not to do so will not impact your ability to
      use the Services. Please be aware that we may have difficulty recovering
      your account information in the event of an emergency if we do not have an
      email address associated with your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      When purchasing products on the Services, we may require you to provide
      financial and billing information, such as billing name and address, and
      credit card number (“Billing Information”). Your Personal Contact
      Information and your Billing Information, together with any other
      information we gather through the Services that may be used to identify,
      contact, or locate you individually, are collectively referred to herein
      as your “Personal Information.”
    </p>
    <h3>Data, Diagnostic & Login Information:</h3>
    <p>
      You may be able to create, upload, publish, transmit, distribute, display,
      store or share information, data, text, graphics, video, messages or other
      materials using our Services (this is collectively referred to below as
      “Data”). Some of this Data may be stored and maintained on our servers. If
      you run into technical errors in the course of using the Services, we may
      request your permission to obtain a crash report along with certain
      logging information from your system documenting the error (“Diagnostic
      Information”). Such information may contain information regarding your
      Operating System version, hardware, browser version (and .NET version
      information in case of Windows systems), and your email address, if
      provided. Additionally, certain login information may be maintained in a
      cookie stored locally on your personal computing device (i.e. not on a
      server) in order to streamline the login process (“Login Information”).
    </p>
    <h3>Usage and Analytics Information:</h3>
    <p>
      As you use our Services, we may also collect information through the use
      of commonlyused information-gathering tools, such as cookies, log files,
      and Web beacons. Such Information may include standard information
      regarding your mobile device, browser type, browser language, Operating
      System, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on our
      web site (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked) or while
      using the Services. Collectively, this information is referred to as
      “Usage and Analytics Information.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Google Analytics to obtain some of the Usage and Analytics
      Information.Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google
      that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to
      track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other
      Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and
      personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to
      Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser
      add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js,
      analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with GoogleAnalytics
      about visits activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the
      Google Privacy Terms web page:
      http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
    </p>
    <h3>Geo-Location Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We do not use GPS technology to collect any information regarding your
      precise real-time geo-location while using the Services. However, we may
      use elements of your Usage and Analytics Information (such as your IP
      address) to determine your generalized location. This information is
      referred to as “Generalized Geo-Location Information.”
    </p>
    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
    <h3>Personal Contact Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We use this information to manage your account, to provide the Services,
      to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or
      request feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for
      service improvement, and to address issues like malicious use of the
      Services. We may also use Personal Contact Information for limited
      marketing purposes, namely, to contact you to further discuss your
      interest in the Services, and to send you information about us or our
      partners.
    </p>
    <h3>Billing Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We use Billing Information to manage your account, to provide the
      Services, and to check the financial qualifications of prospective
      customers and to collect payment for the Services. We may use a
      third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. If we do
      so, such a service provider will not be permitted to store, retain, or use
      Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing
      on our behalf.
    </p>
    <h3>Data, Diagnostic Information and Login Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We use this information solely for the purpose of administering and
      improving our Services to you.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage and Analytics Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We may use your Usage and Analytics Information in a de-identified,
      anonymous way in conjunction with an analytics service such as Google
      Analytics to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for the Services’
      technical administration, to increase the Services’ functionality and
      user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for
      the Services to process their requests.
    </p>
    <h3>Generalized Geo-Location Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We may use this information for the purpose of administering and improving
      our Services to you, such as by providing you with tailored content. We
      may also use your Generalized Geo-Location Information in an anonymized
      manner in conjunction with an analytics service such as Google Analytics
      to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for the Services’ technical
      administration, and to increase the Services’ functionality and
      userfriendliness. <br />If we plan to use your Personal Information in the
      future for any other purposes not identified above, we will only do so
      after informing you by updating this Privacy Policy. See further the
      section of this Privacy Policy entitled “Amendment of this Privacy
      Policy”.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have put in place contractual and other organizational safeguards with
      our agents to ensure a proper level of protection of your Personal
      Information (see further “Security” below). In addition to those measures,
      we will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third
      parties without your permission, except as specified in this Privacy
      Policy (see further “Important Exceptions” below).
    </p>
    <p>

      and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province,
      country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws
      may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
    </p>

      to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal
      Information, to Saudi Arabia and process it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such
      information represents your agreement to that transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is
      treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no
      transfer of your Personal Information will take place to an organization
      or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the
      security of your data and other personal information.
    </p>
    <h2>Important Exceptions</h2>
    <p>
      From time to time we may employ third parties to help us improve the
      Services. These third parties may have limited access to databases of user
      information or registered member information solely for the purpose of
      helping us to improve the Services and they will be subject to contractual
      restrictions prohibiting them from using the information about our users
      for any other purpose. Such agents or third parties do not have any rights
      to use Personal Information beyond what is necessary to assist us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your
      consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
      necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who
      may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
      unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of the Services, or
      anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could
      be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we
      believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in
      accordance with the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a
      corporate reorganization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, a
      sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including any
      due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that
      the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted
      by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.
    </p>
    <h2>Non-US Users</h2>
    <p>
      These Services are hosted in the Saudi Arabia and are intended primarily
      for visitors located within the Saudi Arabia . If you choose to use the
      Services from other regions of the world with laws governing data
      collection and use that may differ from KSA. law, then please note that
      you may be transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions
      to the Saudi Arabia for storage and processing. By providing your Personal
      Information through the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage,
      and processing.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use
      commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your Personal
      Information in a secure environment. We take technical, contractual,
      administrative, and physical security steps designed to protect Personal
      Information that you provide to us. We have implemented procedures
      designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only
      such designated staff as are reasonably necessary to carry out the stated
      purposes we have communicated to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your
      Personal Information. For instance, never give out your password, and
      safeguard your user name, password and personal credentials when you are
      using the Services, so that other people will not have access to your
      Personal Information. Furthermore, you are responsible for maintaining the
      security of any personal computing device on which you utilize the
      Services.
    </p>
    <h2>Sharing Information with Other Users and Third Parties</h2>
    <h4>Public and Private Messaging</h4>
    <p>
      Our Services provide you the ability to send messages to particular users
      (“Private Messages”), as well as to post messages in public chat rooms
      (“Public Messages”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Messages are only made available to the specific user you
      designate. We store information in Private Messages only until the
      recipient receives it on their device. The recipient will only receive a
      Private Message when they log into their account. If the recipient does
      not log into their account within 30 days after you send a Private Message
      to them, we will delete the message from our systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public Messages are sent to everyone in the chat room in which the message
      is sent. We do not monitor who participates in a public chat room. So, it
      is safe to assume that anything you send through a Public Message will
      become public information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encourage you to be mindful of what you put into a messages you send
      through the Services. If there is information you would prefer to remain
      private, we would recommend you not include it in either Private Messages
      or Public Messages. Remember that we cannot control how recipients will
      use the information they obtain from your messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rely on you not to abuse these messaging features. You are not
      permitted to use this feature to send spam, harass others, or, in the case
      of Private Messages, contact people who you do not have the right to
      contact electronically. You are also not permitted to use this feature to
      send personal information about third parties. So, please do not include
      such information in any Public Messages or Private Messages.
    </p>
    <h3>Inviting Others to Use Our Services</h3>
    <p>
      Our Services allow you to send invitations for your friends or others to
      use our Services. We offer you the ability to send these invitations by
      email or through certain social media platforms. We do not store or retain
      any personal information (including names, emails, or social media
      information) about the people to whom you send invitations, nor do we
      store any custom messages you may include in these invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rely on you not to abuse this feature. You are not permitted to use
      this feature to send spam, harass others, or contact people who you do not
      have the right to contact electronically. You are also not permitted to
      use this feature to send personal information about third parties. So,
      please do not include such information in any custom messages.
    </p>
    <h3>Other Information Sharing</h3>
    <p>
      As part of our commitment to our user’s privacy, we store Public Messages
      and Private Messages on our system only until they reach the recipients.
      Once a Public Message reaches the users in the chat room or a Private
      Message reaches its recipient, the message is stored locally on the
      recipients’ devices. We no longer store the messages on our system. We
      have no mechanism to force recipients to delete a Public Message or
      Private Message they’ve received.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be able to share Personal Information with third parties through
      use of the Services. The privacy policies of these third parties are not
      under our control and may differ from ours. The use of any information
      that you may provide to any third parties will be governed by the privacy
      policy of such third party or by your independent agreement with such
      third party, as the case may be. If you have any doubts about the privacy
      of the information you are providing to a third party, we recommend that
      you contact that third party directly for more information or to review
      its privacy policy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary
      for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond
      the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain certain data
      as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business
      purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, nonpersonally-identifiable data,
      account recovery, or if required by law. All retained Personal Information
      will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please note that
      if you request that your Personal Information be removed from our
      databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all of your
      Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints. We will,
      nonetheless, comply with applicable law as it pertains to the responding
      to requests for deletion of Personal Information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if you delete our app without letting us know you want to
      delete your account, we will not know you no longer wish to use the
      Services. Therefore, we may end up retaining your Personal Information
      indefinitely. If you want to terminate your relationship with us and have
      us delete your account, please contact us at: info@Tahadi.sa
    </p>
    <h2>Amendment of this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we
      decide to change this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post or
      provide appropriate notice. Any non-material change (such as
      clarifications) to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the date
      the change is posted, and any material changes will become effective 30
      days from their posting on https://www.Tahadi.sa/privacy or via email to
      your listed email address. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy
      Policy applies to all Personal Information that we have about you and your
      account. The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the
      top of this document. We recommend that you print a copy of this Privacy
      Policy for your reference and revisit this policy from time to time to

      signifies your acceptance of any changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If applicable law requires your opt in consent to any particular amendment
      to this Privacy Policy, the amendment will not apply to your Personal
      Information until we receive such consent from you. To the extent we
      cannot provide some or all of the Services without your consent to such
      amendment to the Privacy Policy, your decision not to consent may result
      in our having to limit your ability to use certain aspects of the
      Services.
    </p>

      European data protection legislation.
    </p>
    <h3>Lawful Basis for Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
      We will only collect, store, and process your personal information where a
      lawful basis for such processing exists, which will typically fall under
      one of the following scenarios:
    </p>
    <p>
      - You, the Data Subject, have given consent to the processing of your
      personal information for one or more specific purposes, for example by
      consenting to terms and conditions on our website, and consenting to the
      terms of this privacy policy;
    </p>
    <p>
      - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you,
      the Data Subject, are party;
    </p>
    <p>
      - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
      Tahadi Team as a Controller is subject;
    </p>
    <p>
      - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
      pursued by us as the Controller, or by a third party, except where such
      interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
      freedoms of you, the Data Subject, which require protection of your
      personal information.
    </p>
    <h3>Use for new purposes</h3>
    <p>
      We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this
      Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with
      the purpose for which we collected it.
    </p>
    <h3>Retention</h3>
    <p>
      We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
      fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
      satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we
      consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information,
      the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
      personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal
      information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
      and the applicable legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including
      Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Information) for six years
      after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that
      it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this
      information indefinitely without further notice to you.
    </p>
    <h3>Your rights</h3>
    <p>
      European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your
      personal information. You may ask us to take the following actions in
      relation to your personal information that we hold:
